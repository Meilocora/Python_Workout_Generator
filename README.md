The Task is to automate one apect of my life.

I build a workout generater, that helps me create workouts for my sports course.
To achieve this goal I built a Flask App, that works with databases to keep track of several exercises and workouts.
The User has many options to create and edit exercises and workouts. Forntend is built with bootstrap and some custom css.
